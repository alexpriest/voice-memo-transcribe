# voice-memo-transcribe

Auto-transcribes new Apple Voice Memos into Alex's Obsidian daily notes.

A new memo lands → it's detected, transcribed on-device (mlx-whisper), lightly cleaned and
wikilinked by Claude, and written into the correct daily note under a collapsible toggle with
the audio embedded for inline playback. Kit texts Alex only when a word is garbled or a link
is a guess.

See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for the full design. Runs on the Mac Mini via launchd.

## Status

Live since 2026-06-29 (Mac Mini). launchd agent `com.alexpriest.voice-memo-transcribe`
watches the Recordings dir + a 06:30 daily catch-up. History seeded/ignored; only new
memos are processed.

## Install (after build)

```sh
./install.sh
```

Creates the venv, installs mlx-whisper, pre-downloads the model, loads the launchd agent, and
adds the audio folder to the vault `.gitignore`.

## Ops

- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/voice-memo-transcribe.log`
- Ledger: `state/processed.json`
- One-time backfill: `python process_voice_memos.py --backfill-since YYYY-MM-DD`
